## How is this different from `react-window`?

This library comes to partly solve the case of rendering dynamically sized items with [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window),
for more information about the issue please read [this thread](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window/issues/6).
Before you overjoy please read the [limitations](#warning-requirements-and-limitations-warning) of this approach down bellow :sleepy:

```

## Usage

![Usage Preview](docs/carbon.png)

Yep. its that simple :satisfied:

## API

The API is the same as [VariableSizeList](https://react-window.now.sh/#/api/VariableSizeList) with some small changes and additions.

#### Changes

1. Instead of `itemCount` you must pass `data` ([read more](#additions))
2. We handle `itemSize` and `estimatedItemSize` for you :sunglasses:

#### Additions

| Property                    | Type       | Required? | Default                            | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :--------- | :-------: | :--------------------------------: | :-----------|
| data                        | `Object[]` |     âœ“     |                                    | All of the data that will be displayed in the list. <br />Each `object` must contain an unique `id` field.<br />For example: `[{id: 1, ...}, {id: 2, ....}`] |
| cache                       | `Object`   |     âœ“     |                                    | The cache object which the list will use for caching the calculated sizes.<br />Check the [example](#usage) for how to create it. |
| lazyMeasurement             | `boolean`  |           |  `true`                            | Whether the application should fill the cache in the background.<br />For more information read the [caching section](#caching). |
| measurementMethod           | `Function` |           | `id => [width]`                    | A function that returns a list of width ranges and or values that the height should be calculated for, e.g. `id => data[id].type === 'message' ? [[320, 400], 600, [700, 1100]] : [600]`. Alternative accepted return values are the height of the item as number and a function that returns the height of the item as number. |
| children                    | `Function` |     âœ“     |                                    | Same function as from `react-window` but passes an additional `itemWidth` prop, this prop is the current item width during render and the (max) value for every range/value defined above during measurement. In this case for item type message: 400, 600, 1100 and other items: 600. Do **not** use the width from `AutoSizer` to make your component responsive, use itemWidth instead. |
| measurementContainerElement | `Function` |           | `({style, children}) => ReactNode` | A custom container element in which the elements will be rendered for measuring. Especially useful for changing the [scrollbar width](#warning-requirements-and-limitations-warning). <br/>You **must** pass the `style` prop to your element. |
| debug                       | `boolean`  |           | `false`                            | Whether the measurement layer should be visible, useful for debugging a custom `measurementContainerElement` |

## Implementations details

### TL;DR:

Just in time measurement with caching in the background.

### Details:

The algorithm is divided into two main concepts:

#### Just in time measurements:

We measure each item in the list by temporary rendering it with `react-dom` in a different application.
For more information please read [this great article](https://medium.com/trabe/measuring-non-rendered-elements-in-react-with-portals-c5b7c51aec25).

#### Caching:

In order for just in time measurements to be effective we need to cache the measurements.
Currently there are two caching modes:

1. Cache only the items that were rendered
2. On top of caching the rendered items a background task will measure each element and fill the cache.
   This is the **default behavior** as it gives a significant performance boost, especially in case of manipulating the data before scrolling through it.
   In exchange there is a mild slow down in overall performance in the first couple of seconds.

## :warning: Requirements and Limitations :warning:

1. Your data doesn't change its size.

   - Your items size must be determined on mount (No `ajax` or images).

2. Currently only supports vertical layout. (didn't have time to implement support for horizontal).

3. All of the styling regarding the items **must** be `inline` or not affected by location in the `DOM`.

4. Changes to the list's scrollbar, especially the width, should also effect the measurement container div.
   Since we pre render the items in order to measure them the size of the scrollbar is important in the pre rendered item as well. This can be achieved in the following ways:

   1. Make sure all of the scrollbars in the application are styled the same
   2. Pass a custom measurement container element via the `measurementContainerElement` prop.
